                    <p>This project served as a good introduction to matrices but I am looking forward to being 
                        able to do more complex projects with them. I had technically learned about using 
                        matrices for transformations last year, but I had pretty much checked out of the class 
                        by the time we got there so I didn't retain much of anything about it. This has been a 
                        good refresher on how they actually work, and I think it's helped me gain a little more 
                        understanding of them. Right now I'm mostly at the stage where I'm jst copying things down 
                        and don't have a super strong idea of how they're actually working, but I'm going to spend 
                        some more time reading about matrices over the week and hopefully it'll click. 
                    <p>Speaking of reading about matrices, I found 
                        <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/building-basic-perspective-projection-matrix.html">this tutorial</a> 
                        on perspective and orthographic matrices particularly useful. It uses a different 
                        approach from what we learned in class but I was able to adapt it for our matrix4 
                        program. I was definitely feeling a lot more lost about the perspective and orthographic 
                        matrices so this tutorial was a huge help in that regard. Otherwise, as I mentioned 
                        I'm planning on spending more time over the week reading some more resources on matrices 
                        (like the textbook) so that I have a more solid foundation for when we move on to 
                        geometry processing.</p>

                        As I mentioned above, a lot of this programming assignment was just copying down the matrices
                        we had talked about in class (in terms of rotation, scaling and transformation). Formatting
                        the code so that it was easy to understand where you were changing values was probably
                        honestly the most challenging thing, but doing it right made the whole experience much
                        easier to understand. I had several issues with the TRS and moonMatrix problems, but all of
                        those were essentially solved by digging into the test file and adding some breakpoints where I
                        subsequently found a silly mistake. The hardest part for me to wrap my head around was the
                        perspective matrix, which is why I went out and found a separate resource. </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, I wasn't able to work with my partner as much as we usually do this week.
                            Some family stuff came up and I ended up having to go back home midweek, which threw off
                            my schedule. We did help each other out a little bit with some of the rotation matrices 
                            and earlier parts of the project but in general out communication was a bit lacking
                            for this assignment. Luckily the whole thing was pretty easy and we both finished it
                            without too much issue so hopefully next week is better. 
                        </p>
